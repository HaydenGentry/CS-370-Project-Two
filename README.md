# CS-370-Project-Two
CS 370 Project Two Treasure Hunt in Python

For this project we were given starter code and supporter files for the model. The code that I worked on in this project is the Q-Learning algorithm from the TreasureHuntGame.ipynb file. This project is similar to the work that I would do as a computer scientist, where I would not have to reinvent an application all on my own, rather I would be building upon the work already done by others. The way I try to a problems as a computer scientist is to break down the problem into its principal components or functions, solve the issues with each individual system, while integrating working systems into the final project. I do this to gain a greater understanding of how the project works while being able to troubleshoot issues with greater precision. As a computer scientist I have an ethical responsibility to keep users safe on our applications as it applies to their personal information, and an ethical responsibility to inform the organization I employed by of any issues with the application to uphold user secuirty and regulatory compliance.
